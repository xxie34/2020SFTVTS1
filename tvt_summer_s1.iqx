/1 =  "Sometimes in everyday life, people experience spontaneous thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are different from what they desire. Like bad habits, these reactions can be both unintentional and extremely difficult to control. In fact, these thoughts, feelings, and behaviors often occur automatically, before a person even notices them or has time to reflect on them. 

Often, these spontaneous behaviors arise from habits that we have formed about the way that we treat our environment. For example, we might have a habit of buying a cup of coffee every morning and throwing away the empty cup into the trash outside of our first lecture. Or, we might have a habit of using a reusable cup each morning when we buy our coffee. Both of these behaviors contribute in different ways to environmental outcomes.

Much of the scientific research on environmental habits has focused especially on recycling and what leads people to not recycle. Building upon this research, many of the examples we will use involve recycling. The core principles you will learn, however, are not limited to any particular way of engaging in sustainable living; they also apply to littering, mindful use of electricity, using reusable items, and any other habit that can contribute to unsustainability. As you go through this presentation, consider how the things you learn may apply to other habits you may have related to sustainability."

After Pete and Joe assemble their futon, they are left with the giant cardboard box. Pete takes the box down the hall to the trash room, but when he gets there, he sees it has no special place for recycling.

This increase in temperature has led to the melting of glaciers and the subsequent rise of sea-levels, which may lead to flooding in populated, coastal areas. Fossil fuels are used to power cars, warm the hot water for our showers and sinks, and heat the stoves we use to cook on.

/1 =  "Let’s take that generic goal of “being more sustainable” and make it SMART. Suppose this person drinks a cup of coffee each morning. Their goal can be made more Specific by transforming it into “being more sustainable by drinking my morning coffee out of a reusable cup.” This goal is now Measurable because the person can take note of how many times they are using or not using a reusable cup. This goal is also now more Attainable because it speaks to one specific action toward sustainability, not making an immediate and total life shift. This goal is also Realistic. Many people drink their morning coffee from reusable cups and it would be easy for this person to find a reusable cup of their own. Lastly, this goal should also be Time-Based – “My goal is to be more sustainable by drinking my morning coffee out of a reusable cup every weekday morning by the end of the semester.”

The success of publicly committing to one’s goals rests on the idea that people tend to become resistant to change after they decide to behave a certain way. This may be through new, external justifications and finding their own reasons for setting the goal through conversations with the people they're publicly committed to. This resistance to change may also be due to a social pressure. After making a public commitment to recycle, Pete might begin to feel more compelled to recycle, because he doesn’t want Joe to think he backed out of his commitment.

For example, we have the social norm of wearing shoes. If one person was not wearing shoes, they might be encouraged to begin doing so in order to fit into the community and achieve social approval. Take a moment to think about some of the things you might do because they are social norms – how you dress, how you wear your hair, and the words you choose to say and not to say when you talk with others. Normative influence can be taken a step further and become more intentional. For example, Pete and others might begin to intentionally and openly model sustainable behavior by using reusable water bottles and work to persuade their neighbors to do so as well. When people are personally reached out to by someone modeling behavior, they become more likely to engage in that behavior as well."

Like bad habits, these reactions can be both unintentional and extremely difficult to control. In fact, these thoughts, feelings, and behaviors often occur automatically, before a person even notices them or has time to reflect on them. 

Often, these spontaneous reactions arise from stereotypes and influence our impressions of other people. These reactions can vary from person to person, but because people are exposed to many of the same environmental factors, such as the same movies and television shows, many people learn the same stereotypes, and in turn experience the same unwanted reactions.

Building upon this research, many of the examples we will use to illustrate unintentional bias involve stereotypes and bias against Black people. The core principles you will learn, however, are not limited to any particular way of categorizing people; they also apply to gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, national origin, political affiliation, and any other category that can serve as the basis for stereotypes.

Because stereotypes about Black people are often negative, people who have learned stereotypes about Black people to a greater degree find it relatively easier to pair Black faces with unpleasant words than the reverse."

Stereotypes can be harmful in these circumstances as well because stereotypes often lead people to make generalizations in a way that can strip the individual of credit for their talents or accomplishments. We can see this when people say things like, “I guess math just comes naturally to you!”, or “Well, you’re gay, so I bet you’ll be a great fashion designer!” This kind of generalization “washes out” some of the person’s uniqueness and individuality.

Being “colorblind” to group memberships is neither possible nor desirable. Noticing someone’s group membership is not the problem.  Problems only arise when we rely exclusively on group membership to make judgments or assumptions about someone, say, instead of thinking about the person as an individual. For many people, group identities and culture are an important part of their lives, and pretending not to see group membership, whether it is race, gender, religion, or another group status, ignores and denies the importance of those identities. Individuating involves recognizing that group membership is just one facet of what makes each person unique.

To use this strategy, a man might imagine how women feel when their leadership or math abilities are called into question because of their gender, or a White person might imagine what it’s like for a Black person to be viewed as lazy and potentially violent because of their race. This strategy can be used either proactively, without any prompting from outside sources, or reactively, after a stereotypic response or portrayal has been detected. Perspective-taking, especially when it occurs after the detection of a stereotypic response or portrayal, is very useful in recognizing the unfairness of such biases and in assessing the emotional impact of stereotyping on others."

Consider the recent mass shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, many recent incidents involving Black people being killed by police officers, or other overt acts targeted at another social group. Extreme incidents like these affect not only the victims and their friends and families — they have profound effects on entire communities, who have to grapple with the fact that, just because of their group memberships, they could be targeted by the same sorts of atrocities. Even if everyone finds such events disturbing and unpleasant, members of the targeted group have the additional burden of feeling vulnerable to similar acts.

For example, if you see a person stumble, that could have happened because that person is clumsy, a personal characteristic, or because they tripped on a rock, an aspect of the situation. As it turns out, research has shown again and again that people usually focus too much on the person — i.e., their qualities or characteristics — and not enough on how the situation contributes to the behavior. In other words, we assume that the person is more responsible for their behavior than the situation is. Discounting the influence of the situation often leads to incorrect inferences."

/1 =  "As we’ve discussed, stereotypes guide our conclusions about people, even if we don’t intend for them to. Stereotypes also make us even more likely to disregard the situation, because the stereotype offers an easy person-centered explanation for what we observe. In many cases, however, this explanation is wrong. For example, if someone sees a woman crying, it is easy to conclude that she is crying because she’s overly emotional, and that conclusion is supported by the stereotype that women are overly emotional. If there were no stereotype about women being overly emotional, someone might have more readily wondered about potential situational factors (e.g., a close relative just dying, loss of a job). Rather than jumping to a stereotypic conclusion related to the person and the person’s group membership, using this strategy involves actively considering whether a behavior could have been caused by something outside the person, like situational factors.

Take the time to listen to the experiences of people different from yourself, to learn about their unique perspectives as well as what you have in common with them. Seeking out such interactions will allow you to meet people who disconfirm stereotypes.

Individuation - Focus on the details that make someone a unique individual
	
Perspective-Taking - Take a moment to imagine what it’s like to be in someone else’s shoes
	
Situational Explanations for Behavior - Rather than focusing on features of the person, consider features of the situation that might contribute to their behavior

^^Today, you will be in a session that is testing one of several new online training programs the University may use with future classes of incoming students. As you start, you will complete a survey and some tasks related to several of the different training programs, then the computer will randomly assign you to go through one of the programs yourself. Please pay attention to the whole program and thoroughly answer each question. 
^^This session will last about an hour.
^^We will send you follow-up surveys to collect additional measures and get your feedback about the presentation and whether you think it was useful for your day-to-day life. You will receive the first follow-up in two weeks, and the second in four weeks. You will be paid $40 total at the end of the second follow-up survey for completing these surveys and the in-person session you are completing today.
